MATLAB Simulation for bidirectional EV (Electric Vehicle) charger.


## Documentation



This is the MATLAB simulation model for bidirectional charger for EV. This works on the princlple of bidirectional buck-boost converter. This model is little different from normal EV Charger which only charges EV from the grid, it also has reverse charging from vehicle to grid. It also allows the owner to sell the extra energy to the grid with other advantages such helping other EV users on the way when they are out of battery and also the solar EV users to store extra energy when their vehicle not in use.
