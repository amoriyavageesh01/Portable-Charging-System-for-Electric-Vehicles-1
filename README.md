This is our submission to the [ Portable-Charging-System-for-Electric-Vehicles](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation/tree/main/projects/Portable%20Charging%20System%20for%20Electric%20Vehicles) project part of the [MathWorks Excellence in Innovation program](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation).

## Documentation



This is the MATLAB simulation model for bidirectional charger for EV. This works on the princlple of bidirectional buck-boost converter. This model is little different from normal EV Charger which only charges EV from the grid, it also has reverse charging from vehicle to grid. It also allows the owner to sell the extra energy to the grid with other advantages such helping other EV users on the way when they are out of battery and also the solar EV users to store extra energy when their vehicle not in use.

## FAQ

#### What is the significance of 0 and 1 switching in simulation? 

Basically this simulation works on manual input i.e., 0 and 1. When the
is power generated by the grid is more than threshold power then then
logic 1 is used and converter works in buck mode that is charging mode
and when the power generated is less than threshold power then logic 0 
is used and converter works in boost mode that is discharging mode.
